            <p class="intro"><strong>Being proud of our traditional wear means being proud of our history. The world of the Filipiniana is vast, with different variants that tell the story of Filipino identity through centuries of change.</strong></p>
            
            <h2>FILIPINIANA</h2>
            <p>Being proud of our traditional wear means being proud of our history. The world of the filipiniana is vast, with different variants and offshoots such as the baro't saya, traje de mestiza, maria clara, and the terno. Throughout time, trends in the filipiniana have changed according to major events in history such as Spanish and American colonial periods. The different kinds of filipiniana show the identity of the wearer. The traje de mestiza, commonly worn by women in studio photos (which were expensive to do), were a more expensive version of the baro't saya, having more layers of lace and silk fabrics. All filipiniana, however, trace back to our roots as they, along with the barong tagalog, are based on the pre-colonial baro.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                Fun fact: Notice how filipiniana's sleeves puff up more from the 1890s to the 1930s? These sleeve sizes are connected to women's rights and women empowerment movements. These puffed-up sleeves made it so that the panuelos, a modesty covering along the chest, became smaller and smaller until they were abandoned in the 1950s.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The evolution of the Filipiniana is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of Filipino culture. Each iteration reflects not just changing fashion trends, but the shifting social and political landscape of the Philippines. The butterfly sleeves of the terno, perhaps the most recognizable element of Filipiniana, emerged in the post-war era as Filipino women sought to express both modernity and national identity.</p>
            
            <h2>Preserving Heritage Through Fashion</h2>
            <p>Today, a new generation of designers is reimagining Filipiniana for contemporary wear. Designers like Ditta Sandico and Mich Dulce are incorporating traditional elements into modern silhouettes, making Filipiniana accessible for everyday wear while honoring its rich history. This revival isn't just about nostalgia—it's about asserting Filipino identity in a globalized world.</p>
            
            <p>The intricate embroidery of the barong tagalog, the delicate piña fabric woven from pineapple leaves, the sturdy abaca—these materials carry centuries of craftsmanship. By choosing to wear Filipiniana, whether in its traditional form or modern interpretations, we keep these skills alive and pass them to future generations.</p>
